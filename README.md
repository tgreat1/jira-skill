A Claude Code plugin providing comprehensive Jira integration through two specialized skills.

## Plugin Structure

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `jira-communication` | API operations via Python CLI scripts |
| `jira-syntax` | Wiki markup syntax, templates, validation |

Each skill has its own `SKILL.md` with trigger conditions and usage instructions. Claude Code auto-discovers and activates skills based on context.
